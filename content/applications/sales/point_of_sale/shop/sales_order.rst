Sales orders in PoS
===================

Point of sale management can expose businesses to certain difficulties, such as the lack of a
particular product in-store. To prevent losing a potential client, they need a way to order products
directly from their shop.

Fortunately, the point of sale application is fully integrated with the sales application, meaning
that one can create a sales order and find it in the pos. Then, they can pay for it, either
partially or completely, from the pos.

Select a sales order
====================

From the **Point of Sale** application, open a new session. Then, click on
:guilabel:`Quotations/Orders` to get the complete list of quotations and sales orders created on the
sales application.

.. note::
   To ease finding the right sales order, you can filter that list on the **customer** or on the
   **order reference**. You can also set the customer before clicking on
   :guilabel:`Quotations/Orders` to reduce the list to one particular customer.

Apply a down payment or settle the order
========================================

Click on the sales order to make a payment. You can either:

- Settle the order **partially**: after you click on :guilabel:`Apply a down payment`, enter the
  percentage of the amount that the customer is paying. Then, click on :guilabel:`ok` and proceed
  with the order.
- Settle the order **completely**: click on :guilabel:`Settle the order` to pay for the total of the
  sales order.

.. note::
   Once you settle a sales order, the applied down payment is automatically deduced from the total
   amount.
